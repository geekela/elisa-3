# Angle Measurement Conversion: Radians to Degrees

This document explains the changes made to convert all angle measurements in the codebase from radians to degrees for better readability and consistency.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Python Files**:
   - Changed all print statements displaying angles or errors from radians to degrees
   - Updated axis labels in visualizations from "Angle (rad)" to "Angle (degrees)"
   - Converted error thresholds from radians to equivalent degrees (e.g., 0.2 rad → 11.5°)

2. **Updated Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - Modified cells that displayed tracking errors in radians to show degrees instead
   - Updated error statistics displays to use degrees with the ° symbol

## Quick Fix for Jupyter Notebooks

If you're still seeing tracking errors in radians (like in cell 103), you have two options:

### Option 1: Add the Angle Conversion Cell

Copy the code from `notebook_cell_fix.py` into a cell at the beginning of your notebook. This will:
- Patch the print function to automatically convert radians to degrees
- Provide a `display_tracking_errors()` function for better error reporting

### Option 2: Replace Cell 103

If you're specifically looking to fix cell 103, replace its contents with the code from `cell_103_fix.txt`, which will:
- Convert tracking errors from radians to degrees
- Add additional accuracy statistics

## Utility Scripts

1. `update_angle_display.py`: A script that automatically updates angle displays in Python files and notebooks
2. `fix_cell_103.py`: A targeted fix for cell 103 in enhanced_training_demo.ipynb
3. `notebooks/fix_tracking_output.py`: A module you can import in your notebook to display tracking errors in degrees
4. `notebooks/cell_103_fix.txt`: Direct replacement code for cell 103

## Best Practices Going Forward

- Always display angles in degrees with the ° symbol for human readability
- Use np.degrees() when displaying radian values
- Keep internal calculations in radians for mathematical correctness
- Update any new code to follow this convention
