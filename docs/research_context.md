# Research Objectives

Based on the document, this research project has the following main objectives:

## Primary Objective

Build and validate a computational model of head direction (HD) cells in the brain's Anterior Dorsal Nucleus (ADN) that:
- Tests the **ring attractor hypothesis** for how the brain maintains a sense of direction
- Incorporates biologically realistic features including learning, noise, and sensory cue integration

## Specific Goals

### 1. Model Architecture Development
- Create a continuous ring attractor network with excitatory HD neurons arranged in a ring
- Implement global inhibition through separate inhibitory neurons
- Design structured connectivity patterns that mimic biological circuits

### 2. Adaptive Learning Implementation
- Develop learning mechanisms that allow the network to adjust connection weights
- Minimize errors between the model's predicted head direction and actual direction
- Make the system capable of self-optimization

### 3. Performance Evaluation
- Test how well the model tracks head direction over time
- Evaluate response to conflicting sensory cues
- Measure robustness under various conditions

### 4. Biological Realism
- Include noise modeling to simulate natural variability in neural firing
- Maintain fixed excitatory connections (as observed in biology) while allowing inhibitory connections to adapt
- Create a model that can be compared to real neural data

## Key Research Questions

The project aims to answer:
- How does the brain maintain a stable representation of head direction?
- How do neural circuits integrate conflicting sensory information about direction?
- What role does learning play in calibrating the head direction system?
- What parameters are critical for stable direction representation?

This research bridges computational neuroscience and machine learning to understand a fundamental brain function - our sense of direction.
